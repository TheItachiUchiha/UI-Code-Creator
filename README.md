# TornadoFX-DnD-TilesFX

Native app displaying TornadoFX's latest features and the ease of integrating existing JavaFX libraries with TornadoFX.
A basic drag-and-drop for a custom object without the use of Clipboard for custom grid creations using TilesFX.  

Notable TornadoFX features:
 - Datagrid paginators: paginate cells with a set cell count per page
 - Models and Scopes: 
    - TileBuilder: builds a singular tile using TilesFX
    - TilePlacement and GridInfo: used to create custom grids with TilesFX
    - GridScope: used to pass information from the clicked datagrid to generate a custom grid
    
Drag and drop only included for 1x1 tiles for now, the main idea is to display the use of creating custom grids and using
drag-and-drop to build your own grids.
